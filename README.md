# PRODUCTFUSION FOR [DOLIBARR ERP CRM](https://www.dolibarr.org)

#  Features

This ProductFusion module offers the following features:

- **Product merging**: The module allows you to merge two products into a single product within the product database. By doing so, it helps to consolidate product information and streamline inventory management.
- **Updating related tables**: The module intelligently updates all related tables in the database to ensure that the merged product information is consistent across the entire system.
- **Stock management**: The module handles the stock levels of the merged products by updating stock quantities in the relevant warehouse.
- **Composed products and variants**: The module takes care of updating parent-child relationships for composed products and product variants during the merging process.
- **Compatibility with Dolibarr**: The module is designed to work seamlessly with Dolibarr ERP CRM, allowing for easy integration and use within the existing system.

## Translations

Translations can be completed manually by editing files into directories *langs*.

<!--
This module contains also a sample configuration for Transifex, under the hidden directory [.tx](.tx), so it is possible to manage translation using this service.

For more informations, see the [translator's documentation](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Translator_documentation).

There is a [Transifex project](https://transifex.com/projects/p/dolibarr-module-template) for this module.

## Installation

### From the ZIP file and GUI interface

- If you get the module in a zip file (like when downloading it from the market place [Dolistore](https://www.dolistore.com)), go into
menu ```Home - Setup - Modules - Deploy external module``` and upload the zip file.

Note: If this screen tell you there is no custom directory, check your setup is correct:

- In your Dolibarr installation directory, edit the ```htdocs/conf/conf.php``` file and check that following lines are not commented:

    ```php
    //$dolibarr_main_url_root_alt ...
    //$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt ...
    ```

- Uncomment them if necessary (delete the leading ```//```) and assign a sensible value according to your Dolibarr installation

    For example :

    - UNIX:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = '/var/www/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

    - Windows:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = 'C:/My Web Sites/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

### From a GIT repository

- Clone the repository in ```$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt/productfusion```

```sh
cd ....../custom
git clone git@github.com:gitlogin/productfusion.git productfusion
```
